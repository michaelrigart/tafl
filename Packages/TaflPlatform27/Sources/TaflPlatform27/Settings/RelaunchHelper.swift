/// new copy is confirmed running. A relaunch never leaves two copies or none, so it:
///
/// 1. waits for the old pid to exit;
/// 2. waits (at most `dropPolls` polls) for LaunchServices to stop listing the old copy, so `open`
///    never finds it still registered;
/// 3. runs `open`, then looks for up to `confirmPolls` polls for a copy of the bundle that LaunchServices
///    lists with a pid other than the old one that is alive, and that stays so for `stablePolls`
///    polls in a row (a new copy that hands over to a still-listed old one exits at once);
/// 4. when none is confirmed, tries again from step 2, up to `attempts` in all, then gives up and
///    logs one line to the unified log, so the failure can be seen.
///
/// A copy counts only by its pid, never by the LaunchServices listing alone, so a stale listing of the
/// old copy is not mistaken for the new one. A copy is accepted only after the same stable polls
/// wherever it is found: after `open`, and when a retry begins. The commands and the timing are
/// arguments so a test can run the real script with fake commands.
